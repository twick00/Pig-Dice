        <p>Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice, and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.

          <h3 style="color:green; text-align: center">Here are the rules</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score, just the total earned during that particular roll.</li> 
          <br>
          <br>
        <li>A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.</p></li>
